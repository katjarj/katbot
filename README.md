Meet Katbot, the bot that acts like me!

To use Katbot, install all the requirements and download all the files in the repo. To complete the initial training, use corpus_trainer.py. You may then run the bot normally and speak to it using bot.py.

To quit the bot/trainer programs, simply type in ':q', 'quit', or 'exit'.

Katbot was created using ChatterBot, originally created by Gunther Cox.

NOTE: This is an old project used to experiment with coding. It is not fully functioning.
